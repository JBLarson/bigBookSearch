All of us spend much of our spare time in the sort of effort which we are going to describe. A few are fortunate enough to be so situated that they can give nearly all their time to the work. \nIf we keep on the way we are going there is little \ndoubt that much good will result, but the surface of the problem would hardly be scratched. Those of us who live in large cities are overcome by the re\ufb02ection that close by hundreds are dropping into oblivion every day. Many could recover if they had the oppor\u00adtunity we have enjoyed. How then shall we present that which has been so freely given us? \nWe have concluded to publish an anonymous vol\u00ad\nume setting forth the problem as we see it. We shall bring to the task our combined experience and knowl\u00adedge. This should suggest a useful program for any\u00adone concerned with a drinking problem. \nOf necessity there will have to be discussion of \nmatters medical, psychiatric, social, and religious. We are aware that these matters are, from their very na\u00adture, controversial. Nothing would please us so much as to write a book which would contain no basis for contention or argument. We shall do our utmost to achieve that ideal. Most of us sense that real tolerance of other people\u2019s shortcomings and viewpoints and a respect for their opinions are attitudes which make us ",

Doubtless you are curious to discover how and why, in the face of expert opinion to the contrary, we have recovered from a hopeless condition of mind and body. If you are an alcoholic who wants to get over it, you may already be asking\u2014\u201cWhat do I have to do?\u2019\u2019 \nIt is the purpose of this book to answer such ques\u00ad\ntions speci\ufb01cally.

They can take it or leave it alone. \nThen we have a certain type of hard drinker. He \nmay have the habit badly enough to gradually impair ",

He may start off \nas a moderate drinker; he may or may not become a continuous hard drinker; but at some stage of his drinking career he begins to lose all control of his liquor consumption, once he starts to drink. \nHere is the fellow who has been puzzling you, espe\u00ad\ncially in his lack of control. He does absurd, incredi\u00adble, tragic things while drinking. He is a real Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He is seldom mildly intoxicated. He is always more or less insanely drunk. His disposi\u00adtion while drinking resembles his normal nature but little. He may be one of the \ufb01nest fellows in the world. Yet let him drink for a day, and he frequently becomes disgustingly, and even dangerously anti-social. He has a positive genius for getting tight at exactly the wrong moment, particularly when some important decision must be made or engagement kept. He is often per\u00adfectly sensible and well balanced concerning every\u00adthing except liquor, but in that respect he is incredibly dishonest and sel\ufb01sh. He often possesses special abili\u00adties, skills, and aptitudes, and has a promising career ahead of him. He uses his gifts to build up a bright outlook for his family and himself, and then pulls the structure down on his head by a senseless series of sprees.

If he can afford it, he may have liquor concealed all over his house to be certain no one gets his entire supply away from him to throw down the wastepipe. As matters grow worse, he be\u00adgins to use a combination of high-powered sedative and liquor to quiet his nerves so he can go to work. Then comes the day when he simply cannot make it and gets drunk all over again. Perhaps he goes to a doctor who gives him morphine or some sedative with which to taper off. Then he begins to appear at hos\u00adpitals and sanitariums. \nThis is by no means a comprehensive picture of the \ntrue alcoholic, as our behavior patterns vary. But this description should identify him roughly. \nWhy does he behave like this? If hundreds of ex\u00ad\nperiences have shown him that one drink means an\u00adother debacle with all its attendant suffering and humiliation, why is it he takes that one drink? Why can\u2019t he stay on the water wagon? What has become of the common sense and will power that he still some\u00adtimes displays with respect to other matters? \nPerhaps there never will be a full answer to these \nquestions. Opinions vary considerably as to why the alcoholic reacts differently from normal people. We are not sure why, once a certain point is reached, little can be done for him. We cannot answer the riddle. \nWe know that while the alcoholic keeps away from \ndrink, as he may do for months or years, he reacts much like other men. We are equally positive that once he takes any alcohol whatever into his system, something happens, both in the bodily and mental sense, which makes it virtually impossible for him to ",

The experience of any alcoholic will abundantly \ncon\ufb01rm this. \nThese observations would be academic and point\u00ad\nless if our friend never took the \ufb01rst drink, thereby setting the terrible cycle in motion. Therefore, the main problem of the alcoholic centers in his mind, rather than in his body. If you ask him why he started on that last bender, the chances are he will offer you any one of a hundred alibis. Sometimes these excuses have a certain plausibility, but none of them really makes sense in the light of the havoc an alcoholic\u2019s drinking bout creates. They sound like the philosophy of the man who, having a headache, beats himself on the head with a hammer so that he can\u2019t feel the ache. If you draw this fallacious reasoning to the attention of an alcoholic, he will laugh it off, or become irri\u00adtated and refuse to talk. \nOnce in a while he may tell the truth. And the \ntruth, strange to say, is usually that he has no more idea why he took that \ufb01rst drink than you have. Some drinkers have excuses with which they are satis\ufb01ed part of the time. But in their hearts they really do not know why they do it. Once this malady has a real hold, they are a baf\ufb02ed lot. There is the obsession that somehow, someday, they will beat the game. But they often suspect they are down for the count. \nHow true this is, few realize. In a vague way their \nfamilies and friends sense that these drinkers are ab\u00adnormal, but everybody hopefully awaits the day when the sufferer will rouse himself from his lethargy and assert his power of will. \nThe tragic truth is that if the man be a real alco\u00ad\nholic, the happy day may not arrive.

At a certain point in the drinking of every \nalcoholic, he passes into a state where the most power\u00adful desire to stop drinking is of absolutely no avail. This tragic situation has already arrived in practically every case long before it is suspected. \nThe fact is that most alcoholics, for reasons yet ob\u00ad\nscure, have lost the power of choice in drink. Our so-called will power becomes practically nonexistent. W\ne are unable, at certain times, to bring into our con\u00ad\nsciousness with suf\ufb01cient force the memory of the suf\u00adfering and humiliation of even a week or a month ago. We are without defense against the \ufb01rst drink. \nThe almost certain consequences that follow taking \neven a glass of beer do not crowd into the mind to deter us. If these thoughts occur\n, they are hazy and \nreadily supplanted with the old threadbare idea that this time we shall handle ourselves like other people. There is a complete failure of the kind of defense that keeps one from putting his hand on a hot stove. \nThe alcoholic may say to himself in the most casual \nway\n, \u201cIt won\u2019t burn me this time, so here\u2019s how!\u2019\u2019 Or \nperhaps he doesn\u2019t think at all.

But we saw that it really worked in others, and we had come to believe in the hopelessness and futility of life as we had been living it. When, therefore, we were approached by those in whom the problem had been solved, there was nothing left for us but to pick up the simple kit of spiritual tools laid at our feet. We have found much of heaven and we have been rocketed into a fourth dimension of existence of which we had not even dreamed. \nThe great fact is just this, and nothing less: That we \nhave had deep and effective spiritual experiences* which have revolutionized our whole attitude toward life, toward our fellows and toward God\u2019s universe. The central fact of our lives today is the absolute cer\u00adtainty that our Creator has entered into our hearts and lives in a way which is indeed miraculous.

Then he had gone to Europe, placing himself in the care of a celebrated physician (the psychiatrist, Dr. Jung) who prescribed for him. Though experience had made him skeptical, he \ufb01nished his treatment with unusual con\ufb01dence. His physical and mental condition were unusually good. Above all, he believed he had acquired such a profound knowledge of the inner workings of his mind and its hidden springs that relapse was unthinkable. Nevertheless, he was drunk in a short time.

I have never seen one single case recover, where that state of mind existed to the extent that it does in you.\u2019\u2019 Our friend felt as though the gates of hell had closed on him with a clang. \nHe said to the doctor, \u201cIs there no exception?\u2019\u2019 \u201cYes,\u2019\u2019 replied the doctor, \u201cthere is. Exceptions to \ncases such as yours have been occurring since early times. Here and there, once in a while, alcoholics have had what are called vital spiritual experiences. To me these occurrences are phenomena. They ap\u00adpear to be in the nature of huge emotional displace\u00adments and rearrangements. Ideas, emotions, and attitudes which were once the guiding forces of the lives of these men are suddenly cast to one side, and a completely new set of conceptions and motives begin to dominate them. In fact, I have been trying to produce some such emotional rearrangement within you. With many individuals the methods which I em\u00adployed are successful, but I have never been success\u00adful with an alcoholic of your description.\u201d* \nUpon hearing this, our friend was somewhat re\u00ad\nlieved, for he re\ufb02ected that, after all, he was a good church member.

The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection. \nOur description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the \nagnostic, and our personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas: \n(a) That we were alcoholic and could not manage \nour own lives. \n(b) That probably no human power could have re\u00ad\nlieved our alcoholism. \n(c) That God could and would if He were sought. \nBeing convinced, we were at Step Three, which is \nthat we decided to turn our will and our life over to God as we understood Him. Just what do we mean by that, and just what do we do? \nThe \ufb01rst requirement is that we be convinced that \nany life run on self-will can hardly be a success.

Admitting he may be somewhat at fault, he is sure that other people are more to blame. He becomes angry, indignant, self-pitying. What is his basic trouble? Is he not really a self-seeker even when try\u00ading to be kind? Is he not a victim of the delusion that he can wrest satisfaction and happiness out of this world if he only manages well? Is it not evident to all the rest of the players that these are the things he wants? And do not his actions make each of them wish to retaliate, snatching all they can get out of the show?

What\u00adever our protestations, are not most of us concerned with ourselves, our resentments, or our self-pity? \nSel\ufb01shness\u2014self-centeredness! That, we think, is the \nroot of our troubles. Driven by a hundred forms of fear, self-delusion, self-seeking, and self-pity, we step on the toes of our fellows and they retaliate. Some\u00adtimes they hurt us, seemingly without provocation, but we invariably \ufb01nd that at some time in the past we have made decisions based on self which later placed us in a position to be hurt. \nSo our troubles, we think, are basically of our own \nmaking. They arise out of ourselves, and the alcoholic is an extreme example of self-will run riot, though he usually doesn\u2019t think so. Above everything, we alco\u00adholics must be rid of this sel\ufb01shness. We must, or it kills us! God makes that possible. And there often seems no way of entirely getting rid of self without His aid. Many of us had moral and philosophical con\u00advictions galore, but we could not live up to them even though we would have liked to. Neither could we reduce our self-centeredness much by wishing or try\u00ading on our own power. We had to have God\u2019s help. \nThis is the how and why of it. First of all, we had to \nquit playing God. It didn\u2019t work. Next, we decided that hereafter in this drama of life, God was going to be our Director. He is the Principal; we are His agents. He is the Father, and we are His children. Most good ideas are simple, and this concept was the keystone of the new and triumphant arch through which we passed to freedom. ",
        "page_63": "When we sincerely took such a position, all sorts of \nremarkable things followed. We had a new Employer. \nBeing all powerful, He provided what we needed, if we kept close to Him and performed His work well. Established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves, our little plans and designs. More and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life. As we felt new power flow in, as we enjoyed peace of mind, as we discovered we could face life successfully, as we became con\u00adscious of His presence, we began to lose our fear of today, tomorrow or the hereafter. We were reborn. \nWe were now at Step Three. Many of us said to our \nMaker, as we understood Him: \u201cGod, I offer myself to \nThee\u2014to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt. Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will. Take away my dif\ufb01culties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will always!\u2019\u2019 We thought well before taking this step making sure we were ready; that we could at last abandon ourselves utterly to Him. \nWe found it very desirable to take this spiritual step \nwith an understanding person, such as our wife, best friend, or spiritual adviser. But it is better to meet God alone than with one who might misunderstand. The wording was, of course, quite optional so long as we expressed the idea, voicing it without reservation. This was only a beginning, though if honestly and humbly made, an effect, sometimes a very great one, was felt at once. \nNext we launched out on a course of vigorous action, \nthe \ufb01rst step of which is a personal housecleaning, ",
        "page_64": "which many of us had never attempted. Though our \ndecision was a vital and crucial step, it could have little permanent effect unless at once followed by a stren\u00aduous effort to face, and to be rid of, the things in our\u00adselves which had been blocking us. Our liquor was but a symptom. So we had to get down to causes and conditions. \nTherefore, we started upon a personal inventory. \nThis was Step Four. A business which takes no regular inventory usually goes broke. Taking a commercial inventory is a fact-\ufb01nding and a fact-facing process. It is an effort to discover the truth about the stock-in-trade. One object is to disclose damaged or unsalable goods, to get rid of them promptly and without regret. If the owner of the business is to be successful, he can\u00adnot fool himself about values. \nWe did exactly the same thing with our lives. We \ntook stock honestly. First, we searched out the \ufb02aws in our make-up which caused our failure. Being con\u00advinced that self, manifested in various ways, was what had defeated us, we considered its common manifes\u00adtations. \nResentment is the \u201cnumber one\u2019\u2019 offender. It destroys \nmore alcoholics than anything else. From it stem all forms of spiritual disease, for we have been not only mentally and physically ill, we have been spiritually sick. When the spiritual malady is overcome, we straighten out mentally and physically. In dealing with resentments, we set them on paper. We listed people, institutions or principles with whom we were angry. We asked ourselves why we were angry. In most cases it was found that our self-esteem, our pocketbooks, our ambitions, our personal relationships ",
        "page_65": "(including sex) were hurt or threatened. So we were \nsore. We were \u201cburned up.\u2019\u2019 \nOn our grudge list we set opposite each name our \ninjuries. Was it our self-esteem, our security, our am\u00adbitions, our personal, or sex relations, which had been interfered with? \nWe were usually as de\ufb01nite as this example: \nI\u2019m resentful at: The Cause Affects my: \nMr. Brown His attention to my Sex relations. \nwife. Self-esteem (fear) \nTold my wife of my Sex relations. \nmistress. Self-esteem (fear) \nBrown may get my Security. \njob at the of\ufb01ce.

Likes Brown. \nsex relations\u2014 \nWants house put in Security (fear) her name. \nWe went back through our lives. Nothing counted \nbut thoroughness and honesty. When we were \ufb01n\u00ad\nished we considered it carefully. The \ufb01rst thing ap\u00ad",
        "page_66": "parent was that this world and its people were often \nquite wrong. To conclude that others were wrong was as far as most of us ever got. The usual outcome was that people continued to wrong us and we stayed sore. Sometimes it was remorse and then we were sore at ourselves. But the more we fought and tried to have our own way, the worse matters got. As in war, the victor only seemed to win. Our moments of triumph \nwere short-lived. \nIt is plain that a life which includes deep resentment \nleads only to futility and unhappiness. To the precise extent that we permit these, do we squander the hours that might have been worth while. But with the alco\u00adholic, whose hope is the maintenance and growth of a spiritual experience, this business of resentment is in\u00ad\ufb01nitely grave. We found that it is fatal. For when harboring such feelings we shut ourselves off from the sunlight of the Spirit. The insanity of alcohol returns and we drink again. And with us, to drink is to die. \nIf we were to live, we had to be free of anger. The \ngrouch and the brainstorm were not for us. They may be the dubious luxury of normal men, but for alcohol\u00adics these things are poison. \nWe turned back to the list, for it held the key to the \nfuture. We were prepared to look at it from an en\u00adtirely different angle. We began to see that the world and its people really dominated us. In that state, the wrong-doing of others, fancied or real, had power to actually kill. How could we escape? We saw that these resentments must be mastered, but how? We could not wish them away any more than alcohol. \nThis was our course: We realized that the people \nwho wronged us were perhaps spiritually sick. ",
        "page_67": "Though we did not like their symptoms and the way \nthese disturbed us, they, like ourselves, were sick too. We asked God to help us show them the same toler\u00adance, pity, and patience that we would cheerfully grant a sick friend. When a person offended we said to ourselves, \u201cThis is a sick man. How can I be helpful to him? God save me from being angry. Thy will be done.\u2019\u2019 \nWe avoid retaliation or argument. We wouldn\u2019t \ntreat sick people that way. If we do, we destroy our chance of being helpful. We cannot be helpful to all people, but at least God will show us how to take a kindly and tolerant view of each and every one. \nReferring to our list again. Putting out of our minds \nthe wrongs others had done, we resolutely looked for our own mistakes. Where had we been sel\ufb01sh, dis\u00adhonest, self-seeking and frightened? Though a situa\u00adtion had not been entirely our fault, we tried to disregard the other person involved entirely. Where were we to blame? The inventory was ours, not the other man\u2019s. When we saw our faults we listed them. We placed them before us in black and white. We admitted our wrongs honestly and were willing to set these matters straight. \nNotice that the word \u201cfear\u2019\u2019 is bracketed alongside the \ndif\ufb01culties with Mr. Brown, Mrs. Jones, the employer, and the wife. This short word somehow touches about every aspect of our lives. It was an evil and corroding thread; the fabric of our existence was shot through with it. It set in motion trains of circumstances which brought us misfortune we felt we didn\u2019t deserve. But did not we, ourselves, set the ball rolling? Sometimes ",
        "page_68": "we think fear ought to be classed with stealing. It \nseems to cause more trouble. \nWe reviewed our fears thoroughly. We put them on \npaper, even though we had no resentment in connec\u00adtion with them. We asked ourselves why we had them. Wasn\u2019t it because self-reliance failed us? Self-reliance was good as far as it went, but it didn\u2019t go far enough. Some of us once had great self-con\ufb01dence, but it didn\u2019t fully solve the fear problem, or any other. When it made us cocky, it was worse. \nPerhaps there is a better way\u2014we think so. For we \nare now on a different basis; the basis of trusting and relying upon God. We trust in\ufb01nite God rather than our \ufb01nite selves. We are in the world to play the role He assigns. Just to the extent that we do as we think He would have us, and humbly rely on Him, does He enable us to match calamity with serenity. \nWe never apologize to anyone for depending upon \nour Creator. We can laugh at those who think spiritu\u00adality the way of weakness. Paradoxically, it is the way of strength. The verdict of the ages is that faith means courage. All men of faith have courage. They trust their God. We never apologize for God. Instead we let Him demonstrate, through us, what He can do. We ask Him to remove our fear and direct our attention to what He would have us be. At once, we commence to outgrow fear. \nNow about sex. Many of us needed an overhauling \nthere. But above all, we tried to be sensible on this question. It\u2019s so easy to get way off the track. Here we \ufb01nd human opinions running to extremes\u2014absurd extremes, perhaps. One set of voices cry that sex is a lust of our lower nature, a base necessity of procrea\u00ad",
        "page_69": "Then we have the voices who cry for sex and \nmore sex; who bewail the institution of marriage; who think that most of the troubles of the race are traceable to sex causes. They think we do not have enough of it, or that it isn\u2019t the right kind. They see its signi\ufb01cance everywhere. One school would allow man no \ufb02avor for his fare and the other would have us all on a straight pepper diet. We want to stay out of this con\u00adtroversy. We do not want to be the arbiter of anyone\u2019s sex conduct. We all have sex problems. We\u2019d hardly be human if we didn\u2019t. What can we do about them? \nWe reviewed our own conduct over the years past. \nWhere had we been sel\ufb01sh, dishonest, or inconsider\u00adate? Whom had we hurt? Did we unjusti\ufb01ably arouse jealousy, suspicion or bitterness? Where were we at fault, what should we have done instead? We got this all down on paper and looked at it. \nIn this way we tried to shape a sane and sound ideal \nfor our future sex life. We subjected each relation to this test\u2014was it sel\ufb01sh or not? We asked God to mold our ideals and help us to live up to them. We remem\u00adbered always that our sex powers were God-given and therefore good, neither to be used lightly or sel\ufb01shly nor to be despised and loathed. \nWhatever our ideal turns out to be, we must be will\u00ad\ning to grow toward it. We must be willing to make amends where we have done harm, provided that we do not bring about still more harm in so doing. In other words, we treat sex as we would any other prob\u00adlem.

We avoid hysterical thinking or advice. \nSuppose we fall short of the chosen ideal and \nstumble? Does this mean we are going to get drunk? Some people tell us so. But this is only a half-truth. It depends on us and on our motives. If we are sorry for what we have done, and have the honest desire to let God take us to better things, we believe we will be forgiven and will have learned our lesson. If we are not sorry, and our conduct continues to harm others, we are quite sure to drink. We are not theorizing. These are facts out of our experience. \nTo sum up about sex: We earnestly pray for the \nright ideal, for guidance in each questionable situa\u00adtion, for sanity, and for the strength to do the right thing. If sex is very troublesome, we throw ourselves the harder into helping others. We think of their needs and work for them. This takes us out of our\u00adselves. It quiets the imperious urge, when to yield would mean heartache. \nIf we have been thorough about our personal in\u00ad\nventory, we have written down a lot. We have listed and analyzed our resentments. We have begun to comprehend their futility and their fatality. We have commenced to see their terrible destructiveness. We have begun to learn tolerance, patience and good will toward all men, even our enemies, for we look on them as sick people.
